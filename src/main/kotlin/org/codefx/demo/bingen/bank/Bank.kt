    /*
     * TODO #4: improve [Bank]
     *
     * Currently the bank hands out accounts (e.g. [openAccount] returns an [Account]).
     * That's weird because it allows customers to interact directly with the account
     * without going through the bank.
     *
     * Instead of acting on [Account] entities all methods should receive and return
     * [AccountNumber] values (i.e. data classes). Before starting to write any code
     * consider carefully:
     *
     *  - what should the [AccountNumber] value class have as fields
     *    (think about what your account number looks like but keep it simple)
     *  - who needs to know about the account numbers? the account? the customer? the bank?
     *  - given an account number how does the bank get the corresponding account
     *    (two ideas: collect all accounts in a map[1] or put them all in the list
     *    and search through that)
     *  - if you have any problems, open a PR with what you have
     *
